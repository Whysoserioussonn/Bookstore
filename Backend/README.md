# HENRY"S BOOKSTORE


## Description

This site was designed as a
backend project for Per Scholas.
It was upgraded to include a front end with React.
User is able to Create, Read, Update, and Delete items from bookstore website.

## Technologies used

* MongoDB- document database(back-end)
* Express(.js) — Node.js web framework running inside Node.js server(server tier)
* React(.js) — a client-side JavaScript framework(front-end)
* Node(.js) — the premier JavaScript web server(server tier)
* Postman — an HTTP client that tests HTTP requests, utilizing a graphical user interface, through which we  obtain different types of responses that need to be subsequently validated


## Challenges

* watching tutorials about react and coming half way into the project only to find out that React was updated and some functions no longer are valid from the tutorial.

* syntax, one little typo somewhere sent my react screen a blank screen a number of times. Hard to debug because no errors were being reported on the front end, just a blank screen. Had to retrace my steps undeleting comments in react that cause the problem. There is a speacil format. 


## Future Implementations

* Adding a login page that requires an email, name, and password

* Creating 2 types of logins, one for the customer where he/she has no edit options and one for the administrator where he/she can add/delete/edit/update the products

* Creating a dropdown list where a client can sort the product by price

* Creating a category field where a client can search by name or type of product


## Installation
* Need to set up accounts for MONGODB for database and POSTMAN for trial and error application
* Packets that needed to be installed into the project folder:
     * dotenv -used to load environment variables from a . env file into the running process.
     * express - used to build a single page, multipage, and hybrid web application
     * express-react-views - used as a replacement for existing server-side view solutions, like jade, ejs, or handlebars.
     * mongoose- used as a library for MongoDB
     * react - used for building interactive user interfaces and web applications quickly and efficiently with significantly less code than you would with vanilla JavaScript.
     * react-dom - package that provides DOM specific methods that can be used at the top level of a web app to enable an efficient way of managing DOM elements of the web page.
     * axios -an HTTP client library. It makes sending asynchronous HTTP requests to REST endpoints like your own backend Node.js server, helps you perform CRUD operations. 
     * cors -  refers to the method that allows you to make requests to the server deployed at a different domain. As a reference, if the frontend and backend are at two different domains, we need CORS there.
     * react router dom
     * mui/icons-material - library of SVG icons used to for icons on header tab
     * mui/material - comprehensive library of components that features our implementation of Google's Material Design system
